# Classification-on-Sentinel-2-Satellite-Image-using-Rasterio-Machine-Learning-and-Neural-Networks

In this project we have a very high dimentional Sentinel-2 Image and we will be classifying each pixel using multiple Machine Learning and Deep Learning models and compare them.
Then we will take the different bands of the same image and so classification on them.
